Manipulate stdout streams. Use x as the current data packet.

useful functions:

buffer(condition, act)
condition: function, return a boolean when the passed in array (called the buffer) matches your condition
act: what to do with the array (called the buffer) when the condition is met. the buffer is cleared afterwards.
example: add a second newline after every newline: npt "buffer(_ => x == '\n', _ => _.join('') + '\n' )"

P.S, I know this readme sucks
